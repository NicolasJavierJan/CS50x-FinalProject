# Compare.me

Compare.me is a web page about videogames. It has articles and a game search feature (you can search by year and/or console or leave it blank
and it will show you every game in the database). The most important part about this web is, however, the Compare Games section.
Accesible only via registering, the Compare Games section lets the user decide if, in its opinion, a game A is similar to game B.
This information is stored in a database, and showed in the individual game page. For example, if I search for "Pokemon Red and Blue", there will
be a page with information about the game, a review, and a list of the top-3 most voted similar games to "Pokemon Red and Blue".
